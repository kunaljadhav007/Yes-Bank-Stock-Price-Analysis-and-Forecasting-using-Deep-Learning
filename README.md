# üìä Yes Bank Stock Price Analysis & Forecasting (EDA + LSTM-GRU Hybrid Model)

Welcome to this project where we explore, visualize, and forecast the stock price of **Yes Bank** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Deep Learning Hybrid Model (LSTM + GRU)**.

---

## üìå Project Objectives

1. **Understand Stock Price Trends**  
   Use EDA techniques to analyze historical stock data and gain business insights.

2. **Build a Price Prediction Model**  
   Use a hybrid deep learning approach (LSTM + GRU) to forecast future stock prices.
